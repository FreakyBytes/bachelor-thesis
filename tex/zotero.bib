(Scharm et al 2015:3)"UnlessU is empty, the algorithm repeatedly removes node n2U T 2 with the biggest weight, which represents the biggest subtree in the queue" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"Fourth, the algorithm improves the quality of the mapping by examining the network structure of T 1 and T 2 in a top-down approach. For every mapping n2 T 2 on m2 T 1 , it compares unmatched children of n and m to find missed mappings" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"The algorithm evaluates the matrix greedily and adds new mappings up to a maximum distance of 0.9. Thus, nodes which have nothing in common will not be connected" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"Additional mapping rules capture the domain characteristics of the processed data. Following the current specifications for SBML and CellML, we prohibit certain changes in the hierarchical tree of document nodes. Specifically, we treat parts of the model as atomic constructs for which we define restrictions on possible network operations" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"This step is a major reason why our algorithm outperforms standard XML diff algorithms." (Scharm et al 2015:3)"insert if an entity is present in T 2 but absent in T" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"delete if an entity is present in T 1 but absent in T" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"move if a node is present in both documents, but either (i) the parents in the corresponding trees are not connected or (ii) the parents are connected, but the sequence of their siblings has changed" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"update if the value of an attribute, a text node's content or the tag name of a node was modified" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"After the mapping, we distinguish two types of nodes: mapped nodes and unmapped nodes. Unmapped nodes n2 T 1 [ T 2 are nodes for which the algorithm could not find a matching node in the opposite tree. These nodes and their attributes correspond to either inserts or deletes, depending on their origin" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"In contrast, mapped nodes are nodes for which the algorithm did find a matching node in the opposite tree. If the parents of such a mapping of n2 T 2 onto m2 T 1 are not connected, or if the sequence among their siblings has changed, then these nodes are included in the set of moves" (Scharm et al 2015:3)"Models are continuously modified. Consequently, new versions of a model are regularly being generated" (Scharm et al 2015:4)"We observe three major steps in model development that result in new versions" (Scharm et al 2015:4)"during the design phase" (Scharm et al 2015:4)"during curation and error correction" (Scharm et al 2015:4)"with updates of the format specification" (Scharm et al 2015:4)"BiVeS detects the differences between model versions" (Scharm et al 2015:4)"BiVeS communicates the differences" (Scharm et al 2015:4)"Reproducibility of model-based scientific results has gained increasing attention" (Scharm et al 2015:5)"Indeed, the ability to reproduce results is a basic requirement for the advance of science" (Scharm et al 2015:5)"comparability of models and their versions. Model provenance and version control enable the widespread use and application of models, saving time and efforts during development" (Scharm et al 2015:7) However, the reuse of models requires the accessibility and comparability of models and their versions. Model provenance andversion control enable the widespread use and application of mod-els, saving time and efforts during development (note on p.7)"Support for version control, however, is still limited." (Scharm et al 2015:7)"Such a combined system stores model versions and detects the differences between them. In addition, it offers support for understanding these changes and filtering them according to the users' preferences, as discussed in the following." (Scharm et al 2015:7)"Its major advantages over existing solutions for biological models are as follows: (i) it recognizes the models' hierarchical structures; (ii) it ignores white spaces, such as indentation, which generally do not affect the model's behaviour and (iii) it ignores the specific order of attributes in an entity. Additional post-processing rules capture the domain characteristics of the processed data and increase the significance of produced deltas. Currently, these rules are static" (Scharm et al 2015:7)"BiVeS helps grasping the changes" (Scharm et al 2015:7)"We are currently working on refining these filters using an ontology for differences. We envision that this ontology, together with tools for semi-automatic annotation, will help reduce the number of displayed changes to the ones that are meaningful or requested by the user" (Scharm et al 2015:7)"Current limitations with respect to output formats are missing support for the SBGN format and suitable graphical representations of models that do not specify a reaction network" (Scharm et al 2015:7)"Improving the reuse of computational models through version control" (Scharm et al 2015:8)},

These workflows are procedures consisting of a series of computational tasks using web services, which may be performed on data from its retrieval, integration and analysis, to the visualization of the results. As a public repository of workflows, myExperiment allows anybody to discover those that are relevant to their research, which can then be reused and repurposed to their specific requirements. Conversely, developers can submit their workflows to myExperiment and enable them to be shared in a secure manner. Since its release in 2007, myExperiment currently has over 3500 registered users and contains more than 1000 workflows. The social aspect to the sharing of these workflows is facilitated by registered users forming virtual communities bound together by a common interest or research project. Contributors of workflows can build their reputation within these communities by receiving feedback and credit from individuals who reuse their work. Further documentation about myExperiment including its REST web service is available from http://wiki.myexperiment.org. Feedback and requests for support can be sent to bugs\{at\}myexperiment.org.},

  abstract = {We present a diff algorithm for XML data. This work is motivated by the support for change control in the context of the Xyleme project that is investigating dynamic warehouses capable of storing massive volumes of XML data. Because of the context, our algorithm has to be very efficient in terms of speed and memory space even at the cost of some loss of quality. Also, it considers, besides insertions, deletions and updates (standard in diffs), a move operation on subtrees that is essential in the context of XML. Intuitively, our diff algorithm uses signatures to match (large) subtrees that were left unchanged between the old and new versions. Such exact matchings are then possibly propagated to ancestors and descendants to obtain more matchings. It also uses XML specific information such as ID attributes. We provide a performance analysis of the algorithm. We show that it runs in average in linear time vs. quadratic time for previous algorithms. We present experiments on synthetic data that confirm the analysis. Since this problem is NP-hard, the linear time is obtained by trading some quality. We present experiments (again on synthetic data) that show that the output of our algorithm is reasonably close to the optimal in terms of quality. Finally we present experiments on a small sample of XML pages found on the Web},

  abstract = {The use of computational modeling to describe and analyze biological systems is at the heart of systems biology. Model structures, simulation descriptions and numerical results can be encoded in structured formats, but there is an increasing need to provide an additional semantic layer. Semantic information adds meaning to components of structured descriptions to help identify and interpret them unambiguously. Ontologies are one of the tools frequently used for this purpose. We describe here three ontologies created specifically to address the needs of the systems biology community. The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides semantic information about the model components. The Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of systems biology models, their characterization and interrelationships. The Terminology for the Description of Dynamics (TEDDY) categorizes dynamical features of the simulation results and general systems behavior. The provision of semantic information extends a model's longevity and facilitates its reuse. It provides useful insight into the biology of modeled processes, and may be used to make informed decisions on subsequent simulation experiments.},

  doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btt018},
  abstract = {Motivation: Only models that are accessible to researchers can be reused. As computational models evolve over time, a number of different but related versions of a model exist. Consequently, tools are required to manage not only well-curated models but also their associated versions.
Results: In this work, we discuss conceptual requirements for model version control. Focusing on XML formats such as Systems Biology Markup Language and CellML, we present methods for the identification and explanation of differences and for the justification of changes between model versions. In consequence, researchers can reflect on these changes, which in turn have considerable value for the development of new models. The implementation of model version control will therefore foster the exploration of published models and increase their reusability.
Availability: We have implemented the proposed methods in a software library called Biochemical Model Version Control System. It is freely available at http://sems.uni-rostock.de/bives/. Biochemical Model Version Control System is also integrated in the online application BudHat, which is available for testing at http://sems.uni-rostock.de/budhat/ (The version described in this publication is available from http://budhat-demo.sems.uni-rostock.de/).
