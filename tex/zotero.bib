"steadily increasing number of computational models are available from open repositories" (Scharm et al 2015:1)
"repositories provide the infrastructure necessary to maintain model code and associated metadata" (Scharm et al 2015:1)
"distribution of models through these repositories accelerates collaborative research and encourages model reuse" (Scharm et al 2015:1)
"Tracking the evolution of a model, that is providing information about changes in the model and its encoding, plays an important role in supporting the user" (Scharm et al 2015:1)
"The need of model version control has been emphasized repeatedly on several occasions (Li et al., 2010; Miller et al., 2011; Saffrey and Orton, 2009; Waltemath et al., 2013a)" (Scharm et al 2015:1)
"relation between versions of a model from different releases can be considered the history of the model's encoding" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"In the simplest case, the history follows a single line along the time axis. In practice, however, models are subject to modifications, including corrections, extension and other refinements" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"during model development, several alternatives are tested, leading to different paths in the history of a mode" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"especially when branches with different modifications shall be merged back into a single version of the model at a later time" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"For this reason, difference detection plays a key role in model version control" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"We refer to model provenance as the field of research that investigates the nature of differences in model versions, seeking answers to the seven W-questions: Who, What, Where, Why, When, Which, With (How)?" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"novel algorithm for difference detection in models of biological systems" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"pre-processes the model documents, maps the hierarchical model structures and post-processes the resulting mappings" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"mapping can then be exported in both machine and human readable formats" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"algorithm is implemented in a software library called BiVeS" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"It distinguishes six major steps:" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"Pre-processing the XML documents" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"Mapping the hierarchical structures" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"Post-processing the resulting mapping" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"Based on the identified mapping, the algorithm computes a delta" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"delta can be converted" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"two versions of an XML-encoded model are translated into an internal tree structure. For every node n in the tree, a hash sum n r and a weight n x are calculated" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"The weight of a node is thus always greater than the weight of its children. As such, the weight represents the size of the corresponding subtree" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"The hash sum of a node n represents the signature of the subtree rooted at n" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"While n r unambiguously defines the subtree rooted in n, n r does not need to be unique among all nodes in the tree. Thus, if n r \textonequarter m r then the subtrees in n and m are identically equal" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"First, nodes are being mapped with respect to their identifiers" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"id attributes in the XML documents serve as identifiers. In addition, we also evaluate biological identifiers, specifically links into bio-ontologies" (Scharm et al 2015:2)
"Second, the initial mapping is propagated upwards into the trees." (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"The connections of a node's children are evaluated in a depth-first traversal of T 2 . If a node n in T 2 is connected to a node m in T 1 then a mapping of parent\dh{}n\TH to parent\dh{}m\TH is suggested" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"If, in contrast, n is not connected, we examine the candidates that were previously suggested by the connections of n's children." (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"andidates which have a different tag name than n and candidates which already have a connection are neglected." (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"Among the remaining candidates, the algorithm chooses the one that received the best suggestions and connects it to n" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"Third, the algorithm makes use of the initially computed signatures and maps nodes of T 2 on nodes of T 1" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"A priority queueU is maintained to sort the nodes of T 2 based on their weights. Initially,U only consists of the root node of T 2 ." (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"UnlessU is empty, the algorithm repeatedly removes node n2U T 2 with the biggest weight, which represents the biggest subtree in the queue" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"Fourth, the algorithm improves the quality of the mapping by examining the network structure of T 1 and T 2 in a top-down approach. For every mapping n2 T 2 on m2 T 1 , it compares unmatched children of n and m to find missed mappings" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"The algorithm evaluates the matrix greedily and adds new mappings up to a maximum distance of 0.9. Thus, nodes which have nothing in common will not be connected" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"Additional mapping rules capture the domain characteristics of the processed data. Following the current specifications for SBML and CellML, we prohibit certain changes in the hierarchical tree of document nodes. Specifically, we treat parts of the model as atomic constructs for which we define restrictions on possible network operations" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"This step is a major reason why our algorithm outperforms standard XML diff algorithms." (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"insert if an entity is present in T 2 but absent in T" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"delete if an entity is present in T 1 but absent in T" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"move if a node is present in both documents, but either (i) the parents in the corresponding trees are not connected or (ii) the parents are connected, but the sequence of their siblings has changed" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"update if the value of an attribute, a text node's content or the tag name of a node was modified" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"After the mapping, we distinguish two types of nodes: mapped nodes and unmapped nodes. Unmapped nodes n2 T 1 [ T 2 are nodes for which the algorithm could not find a matching node in the opposite tree. These nodes and their attributes correspond to either inserts or deletes, depending on their origin" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"In contrast, mapped nodes are nodes for which the algorithm did find a matching node in the opposite tree. If the parents of such a mapping of n2 T 2 onto m2 T 1 are not connected, or if the sequence among their siblings has changed, then these nodes are included in the set of moves" (Scharm et al 2015:3)
"Models are continuously modified. Consequently, new versions of a model are regularly being generated" (Scharm et al 2015:4)
"We observe three major steps in model development that result in new versions" (Scharm et al 2015:4)
"during the design phase" (Scharm et al 2015:4)
"during curation and error correction" (Scharm et al 2015:4)
"with updates of the format specification" (Scharm et al 2015:4)
"BiVeS detects the differences between model versions" (Scharm et al 2015:4)
"BiVeS communicates the differences" (Scharm et al 2015:4)
"Reproducibility of model-based scientific results has gained increasing attention" (Scharm et al 2015:5)
"Indeed, the ability to reproduce results is a basic requirement for the advance of science" (Scharm et al 2015:5)
"comparability of models and their versions. Model provenance and version control enable the widespread use and application of models, saving time and efforts during development" (Scharm et al 2015:7)
 However, the reuse of models requires the accessibility and comparability of models and their versions. Model provenance andversion control enable the widespread use and application of mod-els, saving time and efforts during development (note on p.7)
~
"Support for version control, however, is still limited." (Scharm et al 2015:7)
"Such a combined system stores model versions and detects the differences between them. In addition, it offers support for understanding these changes and filtering them according to the users' preferences, as discussed in the following." (Scharm et al 2015:7)
"Its major advantages over existing solutions for biological models are as follows: (i) it recognizes the models' hierarchical structures; (ii) it ignores white spaces, such as indentation, which generally do not affect the model's behaviour and (iii) it ignores the specific order of attributes in an entity. Additional post-processing rules capture the domain characteristics of the processed data and increase the significance of produced deltas. Currently, these rules are static" (Scharm et al 2015:7)
"BiVeS helps grasping the changes" (Scharm et al 2015:7)
"We are currently working on refining these filters using an ontology for differences. We envision that this ontology, together with tools for semi-automatic annotation, will help reduce the number of displayed changes to the ones that are meaningful or requested by the user" (Scharm et al 2015:7)
"Current limitations with respect to output formats are missing support for the SBGN format and suitable graphical representations of models that do not specify a reaction network" (Scharm et al 2015:7)

  doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btt018},
  abstract = {Motivation: Only models that are accessible to researchers can be reused. As computational models evolve over time, a number of different but related versions of a model exist. Consequently, tools are required to manage not only well-curated models but also their associated versions.
Results: In this work, we discuss conceptual requirements for model version control. Focusing on XML formats such as Systems Biology Markup Language and CellML, we present methods for the identification and explanation of differences and for the justification of changes between model versions. In consequence, researchers can reflect on these changes, which in turn have considerable value for the development of new models. The implementation of model version control will therefore foster the exploration of published models and increase their reusability.
Availability: We have implemented the proposed methods in a software library called Biochemical Model Version Control System. It is freely available at http://sems.uni-rostock.de/bives/. Biochemical Model Version Control System is also integrated in the online application BudHat, which is available for testing at http://sems.uni-rostock.de/budhat/ (The version described in this publication is available from http://budhat-demo.sems.uni-rostock.de/).

  abstract = {We present a diff algorithm for XML data. This work is motivated by the support for change control in the context of the Xyleme project that is investigating dynamic warehouses capable of storing massive volumes of XML data. Because of the context, our algorithm has to be very efficient in terms of speed and memory space even at the cost of some loss of quality. Also, it considers, besides insertions, deletions and updates (standard in diffs), a move operation on subtrees that is essential in the context of XML. Intuitively, our diff algorithm uses signatures to match (large) subtrees that were left unchanged between the old and new versions. Such exact matchings are then possibly propagated to ancestors and descendants to obtain more matchings. It also uses XML specific information such as ID attributes. We provide a performance analysis of the algorithm. We show that it runs in average in linear time vs. quadratic time for previous algorithms. We present experiments on synthetic data that confirm the analysis. Since this problem is NP-hard, the linear time is obtained by trading some quality. We present experiments (again on synthetic data) that show that the output of our algorithm is reasonably close to the optimal in terms of quality. Finally we present experiments on a small sample of XML pages found on the Web},

  abstract = {Office applications such as OpenOffice and Microsoft Office are widely used to edit the majority of today's business documents: office documents. Usually, version control systems consider office documents as binary objects, thus severely hindering collaborative work. Since XML has become a de-facto standard for office applications, we focus on versioning office documents by structured XML version control approaches. This enables state-of-the-art version control for office documents.A basic prerequisite to XML version control is a diff algorithm, which detects structural changes between XML documents. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art XML diff algorithms w.r.t. their suitability to OpenOffice XML documents and the future OASIS office document standard. It turns out that, due to the specific XML office format, a careful examination of the diff algorithm characteristics is necessary. Therefore, we identify important features for XML diff approaches to handle office documents. We have implemented a first OpenOffice versioning API that can be used in version control systems as a replacement for line-based or binary diffs, which are currently used.},

Most previous work in change management has dealt with flat-file and relational data; we focus on hierarchically structured data. Since in many cases changes must be computed from old and new versions of the data, we define the hierarchical change detection problem as the problem of finding a "minimum-cost edit script" that transforms one data tree to another, and we present efficient algorithms for computing such an edit script. Our algorithms make use of some key domain characteristics to achieve substantially better performance than previous, general-purpose algorithms. We study the performance of our algorithms both analytically and empirically, and we describe the application of our techniques to hierarchically structured documents.},

  abstract = {While scientific research and the methodologies involved have gone through substantial tech
nological evolution the technology involved in the publication of the results of these endeavors has
remained relatively stagnant. Publication is largely done in the same manner today as it was fifty
years ago. Many journals have adopted electronic formats, however, their orientation and style is
little different from a printed document. The documents tend to be static and take little advantage
of computational resources that might be available. Recent work, Gentleman and Temple Lang
(2003), suggests a methodology and basic infrastructure that can be used to
publish
documents in
a substantially different way. Their approach is suitable for the publication of papers whose mes-
sage relies on computation. Stated quite simply, Gentleman and Temple Lang (2003) propose a
paradigm where documents are mixtures of code and text. Such documents may be self-contained
or they may be a component of a
compendium

  abstract = {XML has become the de facto standard format for Web publishing and data transportation. Since online information changes frequently, being able to quickly detect changes in XML documents is important to Internet query systems, search engines, and continuous query systems. Previous work in change detection on XML, or other hierarchically structured documents, used an ordered tree model, in which left-to-right order among siblings is important and it can affect the change result. We argue that an unordered model (only ancestor relationships are significant) is more suitable for most database applications. Using an unordered model, change detection is substantially harder than using the ordered model, but the change result that it generates is more accurate. We propose X-Diff, an effective algorithm that integrates key XML structure characteristics with standard tree-to-tree correction techniques. The algorithm is analyzed and compared with XyDiff [CAM02], a published XML diff algorithm. An experimental evaluation on both algorithms is provided.},

  abstract = {There now exists a rich set of ontologies that provide detailed semantics for biological entities of interest. However, there is not (nor should there be) a single source ontology that provides all the necessary semantics for describing biological phenomena. In the domain of physiological biosimulation models, researchers use annotations to convey semantics, and many of these annotations require the use of multiple reference ontologies. Therefore, we have developed the idea of composite annotations that access multiple ontologies to capture the physics-based meaning of model variables. These composite annotations provide the semantic expressivity needed to disambiguate the often-complex features of biosimulation models, and can be used to assist with model merging and interoperability. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of composite annotations for model merging by describing their use within SemGen, our semantics-based model composition software. More broadly, if orthogonal reference ontologies are to meet their full potential, users need tools and methods to connect and link these ontologies. Our composite annotations and the SemGen tool provide one mechanism for leveraging multiple reference ontologies.},

Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved.},

  title = {One File to Share Them All: {{Using}} the {{COMBINE Archive}} and the {{OMEX}} Format to Share All Information about a Modeling Project},
  shorttitle = {One File to Share Them All},
  abstract = {Background: With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result. Results: We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with the use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software. Conclusions: The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in building activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive will become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger, more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital organisms, and bioengineering.},

Remains to be seen which of the multiple solutions created since the official appearance of the NoSQL concept (which was defined in 1998 and reintroduced in 2009, around which moment several NoSQL solutions emerged; at the present moment there are known over 120 such solutions) are really delivering on these promises of higher performance (although several of them are already used with very good results).},

  abstract = {A database design methodology is defined for the design of large relational databases. First, the data requirements are conceptualized using an extended entity-relationship model, with the extensions being additional semantics such as ternary relationships, optional relationships, and the generalization abstraction. The extended entity-relationship model is then decomposed according to a set of basic entity-relationship constructs, and these are transformed into candidate relations. A set of basic transformations has been developed for the three types of relations: entity relations, extended entity relations, and relationship relations. Candidate relations are further analyzed and modified to attain the highest degree of normalization desired.
The methodology produces database designs that are not only accurate representations of reality, but flexible enough to accommodate future processing requirements. It also reduces the number of data dependencies that must be analyzed, using the extended ER model conceptualization, and maintains data integrity through normalization. This approach can be implemented manually or in a simple software package as long as a "good" solution is acceptable and absolute optimality is not required.},

Semantic information adds meaning to components of structured descriptions to help identify and interpret them unambiguously. Ontologies are one of the tools frequently used for this purpose. We describe here three ontologies created specifically to address the needs of the systems biology community. The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides semantic information about the model components. The Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO) supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of systems biology models, their characterization and interrelationships. The Terminology for the Description of Dynamics (TEDDY) categorizes dynamical features of the simulation results and general systems behavior. The provision of semantic information extends a model's longevity and facilitates its reuse. It provides useful insight into the biology of modeled processes, and may be used to make informed decisions on subsequent simulation experiments.},

  abstract = {Over the past years various databases in Life Sciences have been developed , among them databases to handle computational models of biological systems. Exchange formats that represent these models are typically XML-based; they encode models as networks. Models are published together with supplementary materials such as annotations, simulation experiment descriptions , or result sets. In consequence, not only model files need to be managed, but also the associated simulation setups, and highly linked meta-information. We discuss here the use of graph databases for model storage as they well reflect this interrelated nature. They can also enhance the integrated management of computational models and associated meta-information, as they handle connections between models, simulation descriptions and result data files, as well as external knowledge. This property enhances version control, retrieval and ranking, thereby resulting in improved model reuse and result reproducibility. 1 Background Systems Biology is the study of complex biological systems by means of computational approaches and methods. A computational model of a biological system represents aspects of that system, often using mathematical equations. Modeling has become a major tool in the daily work of systems biologists. Consequently, the number of available models has grown steadily over the last decade, and so has the models\&\#39; complexity [He10]. To reuse existing model code, the code itself must, first, be made available in model databases. Second, it must be encoded in exchangeable standard formats, which can then be interpreted by software tools. BioModels Database [Li10] is one example of an open model repository that freely distributes models in standard format. Together with the model, a whole plethora of meta-information is provided,},

  abstract = {Quantitative models of biochemical and cellular systems are used to answer a variety of questions in the biological sciences. The number of published quantitative models is growing steadily thanks to increasing interest in the use of models as well as the development of improved software systems and the availability of better, cheaper computer hardware. To maximise the benefits of this growing body of models, the field needs centralised model repositories that will encourage, facilitate and promote model dissemination and reuse. Ideally, the models stored in these repositories should be extensively tested and encoded in community-supported and standardised formats. In addition, the models and their components should be cross-referenced with other resources in order to allow their unambiguous identification.},
