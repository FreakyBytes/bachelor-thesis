\par \textbf{This work is based on MaSyMoS, a...}
\par \textbf{A graph database for simulation models and
associated data}

\par Many models in public databases encode networks that
can be represented as graphs
\par relational databases were developed for
homogeneous, structured data, e.g. numerical data
\par  Designing a relational
representation for these links and keeping the database effi-
cient at the same time are impossible\par \textbf{MaSyMos is a database based on neo4j for storing and retrieving structural information of biological models}

\par We chose the
graph database Neo4J (25)
\par follows the fun-
damental properties of databases, i.e. the ACID principles\par \textbf{biological models are represented in heterogenous data structures e.g. networks. Traditional relational databases are build to quickly process highly structured data in tables, therefore they are less efficient in storing and retrieving standard encoded models, due to their "highly linked structure"}

\par  No unified schema exists
for models and meta-data, making it difficult to define a
relational database schema
\par highly linked models,
model entities and meta-data are difficult to represent in a
table-based relational database\par \textbf{MaSyMoS data model and structure}

\par document root node is created for each data
item\par \textbf{each model is represented by a model node}

\par entry point for each model import is a document node
\par Attached to the model node
are annotation nodes, including the reference publication
\par in SBML compartments, species and reactions are linked to the model node\par \textbf{in CellML each component is linked to the model node, further containing variables and mathematical relationships to manipulate other variables}

\par component contains vari-
ables and mathematical relationships that manipulate
those variables\par \textbf{Experiment setups are stored under a SEDML node, instead of a model node. In comparison to species, reactions, compartments or components the SEDML node has links to Modelreference nodes, as well as nodes pointing to different model entities used in plots. Nevertheless no processing information is stored in the database.}

\par SEDML node serves as the anchor for an experiment
\par  Modelreference node links the experiment to all
Model nodes used in the simulation
\par do not store the specific processing of a
model entity\par \textbf{"Semantic annotations and cross-references" from the models are stored as seperate nodes and linked to the ontology node representing the used ontology term.}

\par Semantic annotations and cross-references
\par  We parse these ontologies and add all concepts
and relations as nodes and edges, respectively.
\par ensure an easy traversal upwards, a connection is created
from each node of the stored model that points to the par-
ent of the current node. The corresponding edges are
named belongsTo\par \textbf{Linking model related data}
\par \textbf{main advantage to prior mentioned storage in relational databases is the possibility to flexibly link data between different domains. //Henkel et al.// describes 3 different links, which are currently implemented:
1. links between (model) annotations and the corresponding ontology term
2. links between models or model entities and SEDML simulation descriptions or respectively SEDML variables
3. links between model entities in different standard format representation}

\par The main advantage of the previously described concept is
its possibility to define flexible links between the data do-
mains
\par  links between annotations (in SBML, CellML and
SED-ML) and ontology concepts
\par links between models (in SBML or CellML format) and
SED-ML
\par link is that between a model and a
simulation description
\par links between model entities and SED-ML variables
\par  links between model entities from different model rep-
resentation formats
\par For each annotation in
a model we add an explicit link to the data entry in the ref-
erenced bio-ontology
\par This link is shared between all models using this annotation, regardless of the format\par \textbf{Further to explicit links (one hop in the graph), MaSyMoS is able to determine implicit links between different models. Those can be established over shared resources like a publication, publication author or annotations with common bio-ontologies.
Regarding a publications the database may establish connections based on the likelihood of names by Hemming Distance, resulting in a confidence which can be increased, "if the entities' annotations match"}

\par In addition, we determine implicit links between
models of different representation formats
\par If two models share
a publication, the systems can infer implicit links between
those entities that are equally named\par \textbf{Implementation}

\par MaSyMoS is designed to run as both standalone commandline application with embedded neo4j and as an extension to the neo4j server. Latter is controlled by an unmanaged neo4j plugin providing a RESTful json interface.
\par Same interface also cooperates with the retrieval engine Morre, by providing endpoints to query different search indexes.\par \textbf{MaSyMoS project structure}

\par The MaSyMoS project is divided into 3 different modules: MaSyMoS-core, Morre and a CLI.
\par The core module contains the logic of the database and communicates directly with neo4j. It consists of routines and a Java API to import models, experiments and ontologies. Further it fetches linked information from common bio-ontologies and manages, updates and queries Lucene indexes.
\par The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a user interface, to easily interact with the API provided by the core module. It's main purpose was to simplify the development process by skipping the deployment step. Instead it is possible to directly interact with and debug MaSyMoS
\par The Morre module is similiar to the CLI, by providing an way to interact with the core. But instead of providing a user interface, Morre is loaded as neo4j unmanaged extension and exposes a RESTful interface, which can be used to query the Lucene indexes or to push and update models to the database.
