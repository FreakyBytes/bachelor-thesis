\section{Motivation}
- Reproducibility
	- \sedml is useless, when model changes
- Transparency
- Tracking differences
	- what has changed
	- who has changed it
	- oxford2012 + first bives paper
	
- Doing analysis of the evolution of a biological model
- provide a comprehensive repository of biological models and their history
- discover similarities and differences in the development of model through Ontology crosslinking
- Motivation out of koehn2008 \cite{Kohn2008}

\section{Goals}
- extend an existing database to store multiple versions of one model in it
- semantically connect the versions
- store idfferences to allow for efficient analysis
- \todo[talk about possible results]
