\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reproducibility
	\item \sedml is useless, when model changes
\item Transparency
\item Tracking differences
	\item what has changed
	\item who has changed it
	\item oxford2012 + first bives paper
	
\item Doing analysis of the evolution of a biological model
\item provide a comprehensive repository of biological models and their history
\item discover similarities and differences in the development of model through Ontology crosslinking
\item Motivation out of koehn2008 \cite{Kohn2008}
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item extend an existing database to store multiple versions of one model in it
\item semantically connect the versions
\item store idfferences to allow for efficient analysis
\item \todo[talk about possible results]
\end{itemize}
