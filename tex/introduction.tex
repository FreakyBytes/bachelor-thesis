\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Why is Reproducibility important (in life science/Bioinformatics)
	\subitem what is a problem?
	\subitem why is it important?
	\subitem specific points regarding Systems Bio
	\subitem refs to reproducible science
\item Reproducibility
	\subitem \sedml scripts fails, when model changes

\item Transparency
\item Tracking differences (Provenance)
	\subitem what has changed
	\subitem who has changed it
	\subitem oxford2012 + first bives paper
	
\item Doing analysis of the evolution of a biological model
\item provide a comprehensive repository of biological models and their history
\item discover similarities and differences in the development of model through Ontology crosslinking
\item Motivation out of koehn2008 \cite{Kohn2008}
\end{itemize}

\todo[last paragraph of motivation is goals section, summarizing proposed solution]
\todo[research gap ausarbeiten]
\todo[look into MOST for stats regarding model versions]
\begin{itemize}
\item develop a concept to support different versions in model databases
	\subitem \todo[mention masymos directly?]
	\subitem \todo[arg. structure bives->masymos//masymos->bives//generische mdb->version concept->bives->goal]
\item semantically connect the versions
	\subitem relation between versions? + comodi terms
	\subitem ref to semantic web
	\subitem reason -> allow evaluation and analysis
\item store differences to allow for efficient analysis
\item \todo[talk about possible results]
\end{itemize}
