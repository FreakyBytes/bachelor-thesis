		\subitem "Incremental Query Evaluation. When a user has a standing query against a time-varying data source, a change-detection tool can provide the query engine the delta data on which the query will be re-evaluated. Thus, the user doesnâ€™t receive old results and the query engine avoids repeated work. Since the delta data is usually much smaller than the original data, query evaluation will also be much faster." \citep{Wang2003}
